## About
  
## Basic Story
  ProjectLegend is an interactive text-rpg that chronicles the timeline of the main character, It.

  Version 1 of Project Legend serves as a gameplay mockup for how the full game will play. This version will be developed in Unity using
  an interactive Console rather than just a text CLI.
