## About
  Various extraterrestrial beings come through a worm hole only to discover a desolate land. With no identity, you scrape through the land. Here lay dangerous creatures that need to be slain. Only way is to survive. This is a mock-up version of a game that will be crafted in Unity. The link to the Unity Repo is here: (**link**)
